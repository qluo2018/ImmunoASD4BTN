a. data preprocessing
b. group comparisons between two batches
c. nonparametric correlations with FDR between the CARS_total score and 35 cytokines 
d. sparse canonical correlation analysis with permutation
e. k-means clustering and difference analyses on three immuno-behavioural groups 
f. prediction of the treatment response to bumetanide using the baseline information
